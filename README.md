# The Ripple Effect
My personal Blog's source code!

I built the application to be dynamic and Full-Stack. **No CMS or Front-End Framework was used!**

Since I am using a free tier of Heroku to host, if the website has 30 minutes of inactivity, it may take a few extra seconds to load the first time.
After that, it will run like normal.
